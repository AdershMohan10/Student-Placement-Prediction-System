Student Placement Prediction System

This project predicts whether a student will be placed based on academic performance, work experience, specialization, and demographic features. It also provides interactive visual insights using Power BI.

Problem Statement
To analyze student data and build a machine learning model that predicts placement outcomes and identifies key factors influencing placement.

Dataset
Campus placement dataset containing:
- Academic percentages (SSC, HSC, Degree, MBA)
- Gender
- Work experience
- Specialization
- Placement status

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis using Python visualizations
3. Feature engineering and encoding
4. Machine learning model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Feature importance analysis
7. Power BI dashboard creation

Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Best Model Performance
Logistic Regression achieved approximately 86% accuracy.

Important Features Identified
- Work experience
- Gender
- SSC board
- SSC percentage
- Degree percentage

Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Overall placement distribution
- Gender-wise placement analysis
- Placement rate by specialization
- Academic performance vs placement
- Interactive slicers for gender, specialization, and work experience

How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
3. Run notebooks in order from the notebooks folder
4. Open the Power BI file to view the dashboard
